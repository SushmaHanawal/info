1. Ant and Triangle Problem

Three ants are sitting at the three corners of an equilateral triangle. Each ant starts 
randomly picks a direction and starts to move along the edge of the triangle. 
What is the probability that none of the ants collide?

Puzzle Solution:
So letâ€š us think this through. The ants can only avoid a collision if they all decide 
to move in the same direction (either clockwise or anti-clockwise). 
If the ants do not pick the same direction, there will definitely be a collision. 
Each ant has the option to either move clockwise or anti-clockwise. 
There is a one in two chance that an ant decides to pick a particular direction. 
Using simple probability calculations, we can determine the probability of no collision.

P(No collision) = 
P(All ants go in a clockwise direction) + P( All ants go in an anti-clockwise direction) 
= 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

2. Crossing the Bridge Puzzle

Puzzle: Four people need to cross a rickety bridge at night. 
Unfortunately, they have only one torch and the bridge is too dangerous to cross 
without one. The bridge is only strong enough to support two people at a time. 
Not all people take the same time to cross the bridge. 
Times for each person: 1 min, 2 mins, 7 mins and 10 mins. 
What is the shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the bridge?

Puzzle Solution:
It is 17 mins.
1 and 2 go first, then 1 comes back. Then 7 and 10 go and 2 comes back. 
Then 1 and 2 go again, it makes a total of 17 minutes.

3. Burning Rope Timer Puzzle

A man has two ropes of varying thickness (Those two ropes are not identical, 
they arent the same density nor the same length nor the same width). 
Each rope burns in 60 minutes. He actually wants to measure 45 mins. 
How can he measure 45 mins using only these two ropes.
He cant cut the one rope in half because the ropes are non-homogeneous 
and he cant be sure how long it will burn.

Puzzle Solution:
He will burn one of the rope at both the ends and the second rope at one end. 
After half an hour, the first one burns completely and at this point of time, 
he will burn the other end of the second rope so now it will take 15 mins more 
to completely burn. so total time is 30+15 i.e. 45mins.
